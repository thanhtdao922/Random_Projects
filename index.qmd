# About Me

Hello! My name is Thanh Dao, and I am currently a [MS Business Analytics](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/academic-programs/graduate/ms/masters-in-business-analytics/) student at [CUNY Baruch](https://www.baruch.cuny.edu/) in NYC. I previously graduated from [Adelphi University](https://www.adelphi.edu/) in May of 2024 with a BBA in Business Administration and Management, and from [the Bronx High School of Science](https://www.bxscience.edu/) in June of 2020.

I'm a native New Yorker based in [Astoria, Queens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astoria,_Queens) (Fun fact: did you know that [Astoria Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astoria_Park) was the former site of the 1936 and 1964 US Olympic trials?), but I also have a dual citizenship with [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia).

## Professional Experience

I am currently an Administrative Manager at [Bao by Kaya](https://www.baobykaya.com/), a Taiwanese eatery found in UrbanSpaces across Manhattan. My main responsibilities include the following:

-   Automating monthly expense reports to consolidate 140 expense sheets monthly, saving 300 hours yearly for upper management
-   Developing relationships with 15 third-party suppliers, resulting in \$6,000 in yearly cost-savings for the distribution department
-   Overseeing front-of-house operations for 5 locations, including training and managing a team of 30 employees

I am also a Human Resources Assistant there, where I process payroll through reviewing time sheets and addressing discrepancies.

## Hobbies

In my free time, I volunteer at [Astoria Cat Rescue](https://astoriacatrescue.com/), a non-profit organization that helps feed, house, and support the cat population in and around Astoria. There, I help prepare food for cats that are homeless, feral, or abandoned, and socialize the rescued cats to help them get used to humans and find their forever homes.

I also like to do arts and crafts; mainly, I decorate top loaders, draw, or create collages. You can find my art Instagram [here](https://www.instagram.com/moarose922/). I also dabble in knitting and crochet, but I mainly stick to hats and scarves.
